Google Search Result Scraper and Sentiment Detection Analysis with TextBlob
Welcome to the Google Search Result Scraper and Sentiment Detection Analysis project! This repository contains tools for scraping Google search results and analyzing the sentiment of the retrieved content using TextBlob, a Python library for processing textual data.

Features
Google Search Result Scraper:

Fetches top search results for a given query.
Extracts titles, URLs, and snippets from search results.
Saves results in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).
Sentiment Detection Analysis:

Analyzes text snippets using TextBlob for sentiment polarity and subjectivity.
Provides insights into the overall sentiment of search result content.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-search-sentiment.git
cd google-search-sentiment
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Google Search Result Scraper
Run the scraper to retrieve Google search results:

bash
Copy code
python scraper.py --query "your search term" --num_results 10
Arguments:

--query: Search term to query Google.
--num_results: Number of results to fetch (default: 10).
Results will be saved to a file (results.json or results.csv).

Sentiment Detection Analysis
Analyze sentiment using the saved search results:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py --input_file results.json
Arguments:

--input_file: Path to the file containing search results.
The script will output:

Polarity: A value between -1 (negative sentiment) and 1 (positive sentiment).
Subjectivity: A value between 0 (objective) and 1 (subjective).
Example Workflow
Run the scraper to fetch results for a query:

bash
Copy code
python scraper.py --query "climate change" --num_results 20
Analyze the sentiment of the fetched results:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py --input_file results.json
View the sentiment analysis report, e.g.:

vbnet
Copy code
Title: "Climate Change and Global Warming"
URL: "https://example.com/climate-change"
Polarity: 0.35
Subjectivity: 0.75
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
requests for fetching web data.
bs4 (BeautifulSoup) for parsing HTML.
TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
pandas for data manipulation.
Limitations
Google Search Scraping: Direct scraping of Google results may violate Google's terms of service. Consider using APIs like Google Custom Search JSON API for compliance.
Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob's sentiment analysis may not always align with human interpretation.
